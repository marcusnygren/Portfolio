    Vinnova innovation project. Inspired by Scratch Jr, Blockly and Internet of
    Things, we built a playground that kids themselves could remake via
    graphical programming. It needed to be accessible, durable, fun, and
    intuitive. I was a consultant to the researchers; doing feasability
    evaluations, doing the first prototype, breaking down concepts and user
    stories into technical and UX tasks, and technical hand-over after the first
    prototype was successful.

      Project for the global GMTK Game Jam 2022, themed "Roll of the Dice".
      "That theme might immediately spark ideas of randomness and probability,
      or board games and casinos, but as always - you can interpret this theme
      however you like."
